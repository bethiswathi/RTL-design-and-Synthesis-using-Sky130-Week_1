# 🔷 GLS, Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Blocking/Mon-Blocking Statements

## 🧠 Why is gate level simulation is necessary
- Ensures RTL functionality is preserved after mapping to gates
- Uses actual gate and interconnect delays (via SDF) to catch setup/hold violations
- verifies circuit stability beyond ideal RTL simulation
- checks proper initialization of flip-flops/registers
- Ensures scan chains and test vectors work as intended

## ⏳ Synthesis Simulation Mismatches
It occurs when RTL code is not written in synthesis-frendly way. The following are the common causes
- Incomplete sensitivity list: simulation dosen't update correctly
- Blocking vs non-blocking misuse: different behavior in sim vs hardware
- Unintended Latches: missing else/default creates mismatches
  
## (1) Missing Sensitivity List
In the screenshot below, always block is evaluated only when sel is changing. Output y is evaluated when sel is not changing though i0 and i1 are changing. Hence it acts as a latch. The right side code is correct design coding for mux. In this case always is evaluated for any signal changes.

## (2) Blocking vs Non-blocking assignments
## Blocking Statements
- Represented by (=)
- Executes statements sequentially in order- one statement blocks the next until it finishes
- Used mainly for combinational logic
- Top-down approach

## Non-Blocking Statements
- Represented by ( <= )
- Allows all RHS to be evaluated first when always block is entered
- Used mainly for sequential logic (flip-flops)
- Allows multiple registers to update simultaneously in simulation

### Blocking statements Leading to Synthesis Simulation Mismatch
When synthesized both lead to the same circuit but simulation result will vary in behavior. For the left side code, y gets old q0 value and for the right side code y gets the latest q0 value leading to synthesis simulation mismatch. This issue can be resolved by using non-blocking statements.
